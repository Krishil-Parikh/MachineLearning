## Linear Regression (From Scratch)

### Model Equation
y = Xw + b

### Loss Function
Mean Squared Error (MSE)

### Optimization
Gradient Descent:
∂L/∂w = (2/n) Xᵀ(Xw − y)

### Regularization
L2 (Ridge):
λ ||w||²

### When to Use
- Linear relationships
- Interpretable models
- Small to medium datasets

### Limitations
- Cannot model non-linearity
- Sensitive to outliers
