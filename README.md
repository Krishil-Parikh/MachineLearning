# Machine Learning From Scratch 🧠

A comprehensive, educational repository containing **machine learning algorithms implemented entirely from scratch** using **pure NumPy**, with a strong focus on **understanding the mathematics, optimization, and design principles** behind each model.

This repository is designed to help learners move beyond black-box libraries and truly understand **how machine learning works internally**.

---

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

- Implement ML algorithms **without using scikit-learn, PyTorch, or TensorFlow**
- Build strong intuition for **loss functions, gradients, and optimization**
- Provide **clean, readable, and well-documented implementations**
- Serve as a **learning reference**, not just a code dump
- Help with **interview preparation and concept revision**
